# Spotify Clone Backend

This repository contains the backend code for a Spotify clone application, providing a robust server-side implementation to support functionalities similar to the popular music streaming platform Spotify.

## Overview

The Spotify Clone Backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API that handles user authentication, music streaming, playlist management, and other core features required for a music streaming service. It interfaces with a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store user information, playlists, songs, and other relevant data.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration, login, and authentication using secure mechanisms (e.g., JWT).

- **Music Streaming**: Provides endpoints to stream, play, and manage music tracks. Supports features such as play, pause, skip, shuffle, and repeat.

- **Playlists and Library Management**: Enables users to create, manage, and organize playlists, add songs to their library, and customize playlists according to their preferences.

- **Search and Discovery**: Allows users to search for songs, albums, artists, and discover new music based on genres, recommendations, or user preferences.

- **Social Features**: Incorporates social functionalities such as following other users, sharing playlists, and collaborating on playlists with friends.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend server environment.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user data and playlist information.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
